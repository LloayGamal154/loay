              Ranked as Egypt’s best High School, STEM High School for Boys – 6 of October was initiated as the product of a partnership between the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), World Learning and its sub-recipients the ECASE project to provide technical assistance to the Ministry of Education to establish STEM schools in Egypt. Offering a unique system that focuses on scientific, mathematical and technological fields, STEM schools target high-potential students who demonstrate strong academic skills. Taught by professors involved in post-teacher studies, the core skills and values acquired by the students throughout the curriculum emphasize and promote critical inquiry and research, problem solving skills, intellectual curiosity, and social responsibility. As the first of its kind in Egypt, the school serves applicants from different governorates: Cairo, Giza, Qalubia, Fayoum, Bani Souwaif, as well as the cities near 6 of October city.
